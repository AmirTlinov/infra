 [LEGEND]
PRINCIPLE = A durable rule that trades off local optimization for global clarity.

 [CONTENT]
This repo prefers principles ([PRINCIPLE]) that optimize for long-term clarity:
- Contracts over conventions.
- Deterministic checks over “works on my machine”.
- Small, reversible changes over heroic refactors.
- Safe defaults over “power user” footguns (explicit opt-in for unsafe actions).
- Centralized dispatch over scattered behavior (one [TOOL_EXECUTOR] path).
