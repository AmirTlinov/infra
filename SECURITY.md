# Security policy

Please report security issues privately via a [SECURITY_REPORT] channel.

Preferred path:
- If this repo is hosted on GitHub, open a private Security Advisory.
- Otherwise, contact the maintainers through a private channel agreed for your org.

Include:
- Clear reproduction steps.
- Affected versions or commit hashes.
- Expected vs actual behavior.
- Potential [IMPACT] and data exposure risk.

We will acknowledge receipt and provide a remediation timeline once triaged.
