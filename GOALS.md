Goals ([GOAL]):
- Ship an ops-grade MCP toolchain that is fast, predictable, and easy for AI agents to use.
- Make behavior explicit and reusable via contracts + deterministic docs.
- Keep changes safe via a fail-closed gate and focused regression tests.
- Prefer hard safety defaults (secrets redaction, explicit unsafe toggles).

Non-goals ([NON_GOAL]):
- Perfect completeness on day 1.
- Becoming a general-purpose workflow engine for everything.
